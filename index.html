		<h2>About</h1>
			<p>V-Sum is a virtually distributed conference spawned from <a href="https://twitter.com/bpmilne/status/1269269646903033856">friendly discussion.</a></p>
		<h2>What's in a name</h1>
			<p>(v)alue - (sum)summit. Weâ€™re exploring the value stack of the internet with every briefing.</p>

			<p>We hold technology briefings on a regular basis and moderate spirited discussions in small groups. Everyone who attends participates. Our events have no cost to attend and are designed for people who want to stay informed on cutting edge finance technology. All communication and scheduling is through e-mail.</p>
