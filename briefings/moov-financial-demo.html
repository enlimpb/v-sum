			<h2>About Moov</h2>
				<p>Moov is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for embedding banking services within any application.</p>
			<h2>Overview of briefing</h2>
				<p>0:00-5:30 Background on the Moov idea & Progress</p>
				<p>Background and introduction by Wade Arnold. Moov was started after Wade's experience building FinTech companies and investing in new technology. After selling his last company to Jack Henry he noticed that new companies keep resolving the same technical problems that start at low level protocols of banking. Moov's solution is built on low level building blocks because they believe that's how you fix banking technology. They've built a developer community with over 1,000 people and continue to build their open source products with the community. Use cases of Moov libraries have already been tested with Bank of America, Square, Paypal, and Visa transactions.</p>
				<p> 5:30 - 8:45 Discussion of Moov community and use cases</p>
				<p> A gap exists in the way that FinTech technologies are built in comparison to the open source and cryptocurrency community in that it's a black box and not a lot isshared. Moov has focused on building it's open source community on Github & Slack.</p>
				<p>An ACH library is one of the solutions there are many others. For example, watchlist type lists for AML/CTF/KYC/OFAC searching, consumer credit history reporting or IRS reporting. Using community sourced libraries saves time from building your own solutions from scratch without turning everything over to a third party.</p>
				<p>8:45 - ACH Library Demo</p>
				<p>ACH file formats are interesting and complex to build on but use formatting and language that most people don't know. The library allows you to go to package and feed in JSON so you start with something intuitive and easy to use. It's available as a Docker image. During the a demo a PPD Debit was demonstrated without interacting with ACH files. Other examples of the communities work can be seen at demo.moov.io/ach where you can take ACH files and output them into usable JSON.</p>
